        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        <p>
            This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and
            cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.

            <h2> Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Put pasta water on to boil:</h3>
                </li>
                Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on
                high
                heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so
                prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.
                <li>
                    <h3> Brown the ground beef: </h3>
                </li>
                In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until
                it is
                lightly browned on all sides. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a
                tablespoon of
                fat.
                </li>

                    <h3> Boil the pasta:</h3>
                </li>
                By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles
                and cook
                them to al dente, per package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)
                Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the
                entire
                cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.

                When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be
                sticking
                together.

                Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet,
                turning
                them over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking
                together.
